Taken from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17881116/how-to-change-bower-default-cache-git-templates-completion-folder-locations

I met same problem, after some tries according the spec doc, i give up...

so I reviewed bower history at github, i found these:

before v0.10.0, bower use config.cache (lib/core/ResolveCache.js)
after that, satazor rewrite bower core, he use config.storage.cache at the beginning, i bet the spec doc is write at this moment. in spec:
storage [object]

Where to store persistent data, such as cache, needed by bower. Defaults to paths that > suite the OS/platform. Valid keys are cache, registry, links, completion.

after this commit, satazor use config.storage.packages instead of config.storage.cache

after that, v1.0.0 release, the config is always to be config.storage.packages. but the spec doc not sync this change

solution

so, solution is one of below:

export environment variable "bower_storage__packages"
use .bowerrc, config like this:

{ "storage":{ "packages":"/path/to/cache" } }

PS:I think the spec doc link to google doc is not a good idea, maybe in github is more sensible choice(we can pull request).
