sc sdshow <service_name>
Then get SID of user that should start and stop the service
* regedit -> HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
* get SID from name of key whose ProfileImagePath includes the user
Now that we have the SID, output service's sdshow to file
* take first (A;;...;;SY) copy and paste before any S:(AU;...
* replace SY with SID, add sc sdset <service_name> to front and run it in admin cmd

If you do the above as written, I think the user would get admin privileges to the service instead of just changing SY to your SID change the capital letters to RPWPCR so you get (A;;RPWPCR;;;<SID>)

Expected Result:
[SC] SetServiceObjectSecurity SUCCESS
