Website to possibly do this without using JavaSSL.zip, which is a program I dled from internet:

I've recently needed to connect our Jenkins CI server to several internal servers such as Jira and IRC (Fun post coming soon on Jenkins@IRC..).

The problem with these servers are that their SSL certificates are selfsigned. This causes Jenkins to fail when connecting to the servers with the following error (Which you can see in the Jenkins log):

javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException:
PKIX path building failed:
sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException:
unable to find valid certification path to requested target
To solve the problem, instead of going through Java keysigning hell, download JavaSSL.zip, extract the files and open a command prompt or shell to the extracted folder.

Then run :

java InstallCert yourServerOrIP
By default, it'll try port 443, however if you need a custom port, say 8888 run:

java InstallCert yourServerOrIP:8888
When prompted, accept the certificate. This will create a file called 'jssecacer' in the same directory. Notice that the command will list a alias for your server, 'll use that later.

Now copy / symlink the 'jssecacert' into $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security. If you can't find your JAVA_HOME dir, try ls -l /usr/bin/java on *nix, or the installed java directory in your program files on Windows. Furthermore, copy / symlink the same file to your home directory and rename to ".keystore"

To test that it works, run:

keytool -list
When prompted for a password, enter "changeit"

You should now be able to see the certificate you imported. To narrow down the keytool search, you can run

keytool -list -alias yourServerAlias
where alias is the name you should have seen in the end of the InstallCert command.

To test that the connection works, we'll run:

java SSLPoke yourServerOrIP
or if you need a custom port, for example 8888:

java SSLPoke yourServerOrIP 8888
Hopefully you'll get a connection succeded, if so, restart Jenkins, and you should be able to connect to the self signed certificated server.
